# Python Learning Kit üêç

Welcome to the Python Basics Repository! This repository is designed to help beginners learn Python programming through simple but real-life-based examples. 

Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your skills, you'll find something useful here. My recommendation would be to follow these examples day by day at your own pace.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts aimed at teaching fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and more. Each script focuses on a specific task, making it easy for learners to understand and apply the concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/EzgiTastan/pythonPracticeKit.git
```
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and explore the scripts. Execute them using a Python interpreter to see the results.

### Repository Structure
I'll be adding more directories and scripts in the future to cover additional Python basics. Currently, we have: 

- Even Numbers: Scripts for adding the even numbers till what the user provides for us.
- Highest Score: Scripts for finding the highest score in a list.
- Password generator: consists of easy and hard level generators. While the easy one combines different elements(numbers, letters, symbols) in order, the hard one will shuffle those inside a list and return a much functional output :)

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! üéâ
